## Overview

The cytoverse is a set of packages that are commonly used for cytometry data analysis. The __cytoverse__ package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the cytoverse in a single command. It also provides helper commands to check the versions of installed cytoverse packages.


## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install the cytoverse package
devtools::install_github("RGLab/cytoverse")
# Load the package
library(cytoverse)
# Install all cytoverse packages and their dependencies
cytoverse_update()
```

## Usage

`library(cytoverse)` will load the core cytoverse packages (once they are installed): 

* [flowWorkspace](http:/github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspace), for gated data interaction.
* [ggcyto](http:/github.com/RGLab/ggcyto), for data visualisation.
* [openCyto](http:/github.com/RGLab/openCyto), for auto gating.
* [CytoML](http:/github.com/RGLab/CytoML), for data analysis import/export through gatingML/xml.


```{r example}
library(cytoverse)
```
